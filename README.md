```A program that follows Luhn algorithm for validating a credit card. The Luhn algorithm or Luhn formula, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, named after its creator, IBM scientist Hans Peter Luhn, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, National Provider Identifier numbers in the United States, Canadian Social Insurance Numbers, Israeli ID Numbers, South African ID Numbers, Swedish National identification numbers, Swedish Corporate Identity Numbers (OrgNr), Greek Social Security Numbers (ΑΜΚΑ), SIM card numbers and survey codes appearing on McDonald's, Taco Bell, and Tractor Supply Co. receipts. It is described in U.S. Patent No. 2,950,048, granted on August 23, 1960.The algorithm is in the public domain and is in wide use today. It is specified in ISO/IEC 7812-1.[2] It is not intended to be a cryptographically secure hash function; it was designed to protect against accidental errors, not malicious attacks. Most credit cards and many government identification numbers use the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from mistyped or otherwise incorrect numbers```.

## How to run it <img height="52" width="52" src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92999481/166147080-e3baac9b-3d24-439d-aa7b-4eec7a59edc2.png">

**```[1]```** All files must be in the **same** folder. <br>
**```[2]```** You can run this program using and IDE like **```PyCharm```**, or a text editor like **```Visual Studio Code```** (python extension(s) is/are required).

- If you use **```PyCharm```** You may get an error saying **```No Python interpreter configured for this project```**, in this case, PyCharm may suggest you solution(s) for this issue, the problem is because the interpreter path is set for my computer, for other computers, the path is different so you will need to simply set the interpreter path accordingly to your computer. If you can't work out this, you can simply copy the code from **```main.py```** in a new project and you are good.
